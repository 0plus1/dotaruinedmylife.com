### Install
This web app uses [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

quickly run eslint with:
```bash
bash run-linter.bash # Uses locally installed copy of eslint
```

### Why
dotaruinedmylife.com has been my playground to test new technologies for years, I have now decided to settle on a react+redux frontend and open it to the community to hopefullyiscover better practices trough community contributions.
